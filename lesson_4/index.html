               The New York Times was founded as the New-York Daily Times on September 18, 1851. Founded by journalist
               and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond and former banker George Jones, the Times was initially published by
               Raymond, Jones & Company.
            </span> Early investors in the company included Edwin B. Morgan, Christopher
            Morgan, and Edward B. Wesley. Sold for a penny (equivalent to $0.33 in 2021), the inaugural edition
            attempted to address various speculations on its purpose and positions that preceded its release:
         </p>
         <div class="quote">
            We shall be Conservative, in all cases where we think Conservatism essential to the public good;—and we
            shall be Radical in everything which may seem to us to require radical treatment and radical reform. We
            do not believe that everything in Society is either exactly right or exactly wrong;—what is good we
            desire to preserve and improve;—what is evil, to exterminate, or reform.
         </div>
         <p>
            <span>
               In 1852, the newspaper started a western division, The Times of California, which arrived whenever a mail
               boat from New York docked in California.
            </span> The effort failed once local California newspapers came into
            prominence
         </p>
         <p>
            On September 14, 1857, the newspaper officially shortened its name to The New-York Times. The hyphen in
            the city name was dropped on December 1, 1896.On April 21, 1861, The New York Times began publishing a
            Sunday edition to offer daily coverage of the Civil War.
         </p>
         <p>
            <span>
               The main office of The New York Times was attacked during the New York City draft riots. The riots,
               sparked by the institution of a draft for the Union Army, began on July 13, 1863. On "Newspaper Row",
               across from City Hall, co-founder Henry Raymond stopped the rioters with Gatling guns, early machine
               guns, one of which he wielded himself.
            </span> The mob diverted, instead attacking the headquarters of
            abolitionist publisher Horace Greeley's New York Tribune until being forced to flee by the Brooklyn City
            Police, who had crossed the East River to help the Manhattan authorities.

         <p>In addition to its New York City headquarters, the paper has newsrooms in London and Hong Kong.
            Its Paris newsroom, which had been the headquarters of the paper's international edition, was closed in
            2016, although the city remains home to a news bureau and an advertising office. The paper also
            has an editing and wire service center in Gainesville, Florida.</p>
         <p>As of 2013, the newspaper had six news bureaus in the New York region, 14 elsewhere in the United States,
            and 24 in other countries</p>
         <p>In 2009, Russ Stanton, editor of the Los Angeles Times, a competitor, stated that the newsroom of The New
            York Times was twice the size of the Los Angeles Times, which had a newsroom of 600 at the time.</p>

         <h3 id="Ochs-Sulzberger">Ochs-Sulzberger family</h3>
         <p>In 1896, Adolph Ochs bought The New York Times, a money-losing newspaper, and formed the New York Times
            Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, one of the United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned The New York
            Times ever since. The publisher went public on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the American
            Stock Exchange. After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast
            majority of Class B voting shares. Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights, while Class
            B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.</p>
         <p>
            The Ochs-Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company's class B shares. Any alteration
            to the dual-class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the
            Ochs-Sulzberger family trust. The trust board members are Daniel H. Cohen, James M. Cohen, Lynn G. Dolnick,
            Susan W. Dryfoos, Michael Golden, Eric M. A. Lax, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., and Cathy J. Sulzberger.
         </p>
         <p>Turner Catledge, the top editor at The New York Times from 1952 to 1968, wanted to hide the ownership
            influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions,
            complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos, he would erase the publisher's identity
            before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the
            memos, it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner
         </p>
         <h3 id="Public">Public editors</h3>
         <p>The position of public editor was established in 2003 to "investigate matters of journalistic integrity";
            each public editor was to serve a two-year term.The post "was established to receive reader complaints and
            question Times journalists on how they make decisions." The impetus for the creation of the public
            editor position was the Jayson Blair affair. Public editors were: Daniel Okrent (2003–2005), Byron Calame
            (2005–2007), Clark Hoyt (2007–2010) (served an extra year), Arthur S. Brisbane (2010–2012), Margaret
            Sullivan (2012–2016) (served a four-year term), and Elizabeth Spayd (2016–2017). In 2017, the Times
            eliminated the position of public editor.</p>

         <p>The New York Times International Edition is a print version of the paper tailored for readers outside the
            United States. Formerly a joint venture with The Washington Post named The International Herald Tribune, The
            New York Times took full ownership of the paper in 2002 and has gradually integrated it more closely into
            its domestic operations.</p>
